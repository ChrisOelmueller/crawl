`badforum` learndb entries on June 27, 2013
------------------------------------------

1. Make skill levels in magic skills (spellcasting, fire magic, hexes...) give a penalty to HP.
1. I have NO problems with having challenge Races. However, It is a BIG mistake to have Ogres fill in that gap. (It is by far the worst design choice made by the devs for this game IMHO)
1. Also - what if armour had a chance of getting its EV penalty lowered by the "ECW I" aspect of the scroll?
1. Revise Orc Priest smiting ability. Transform it to reduce a target to 1-15% of total health
1. Equipment in crawl is generally a bit of a nobrainer IMO.
1. Right now, ash is just a pet project god for people that want to do endless zig runs (boring and cumbersome).
1. As in, all enemies fall in one of two categories: popcorn and extremely dangerous (liches, including Boris fall into the first category for example, steam dragons in the second - even with rElec and 50+ SH) with little to no middle ground.
1. Haste isn't worth it over stasis
1. Shadow Creatures can get you Orbs of Fire to fight against Orbs of Fire.
1. AC is all but irrelevant to Spriggans
1. Im still standing to my word.the gong is the answer to all my prayers!!
1. the guaranteed starting shield tends to be a stronger choice than beginning with Trog.
1. nerf uncontrolled blink by allowing it to land you in lava/deep water. compensate by making levitation level 1.
1. In the course of 17 turns you went from what I'm assuming is full/near full health to 10 HP. That's insane.
1. An idea that just popped in my head. Maybe this has been discussed before; A mutation which causes you to forget things.
1. An idea that just popped in my head. Maybe this has been discussed before; A mutation which causes you to forget things.
1. An MDFi who does Elf with no rN can drop over 5-10 levels.
1. If you don't find at least rN+ on elf 5, I would either switch to TSO (rN+++ at full piety) and scum abyss for piety, or try slime pits for the third rune
1. The damndest thing about Swamp is how cool those wisps are, and how they can ruin a caster's day if he doesnt stop and think a little bit.
1. Having a shield stat of 60+ has serious implications on the game and makes almost everything trivial.
1. Let the player cultivate a garden. Gardening is an active and optional interaction and it would make the game more interesting for the players who chose to do it. Players who hated carving chunks could just farm all their food somewhere. Since fruit is faster to eat anyway, this would be a strategic decision as well.
1. You shouldn't put anything into weapon skills before XL10, and you should be sure to pick one by XL15. If you find something nice between those points, go for it. If you're XL15, you can't wait any longer and will need to settle for something FAST.
1. see <a href="#evilyvon">evilyvon</a>: I dont find okawaru helpful at all since Im really stingy with my hunger cost so I usually die before I activate heroism. also its very hard to find the 3 books that contain dragonform so I would think sif muna definately fit the build alot more unless you find the book early then should just go okawaru or evilyvon.
1. I just lost all of my elite named and leveled up orc warriors and spell casters, as well as all of my lesser orc minions to an elf named Nikola on level two of the Elf Mines.
1. What if you couldn't use a wand in the normal way, but instead, being a furry animal, you could charge your fur with it's ambient static power. as a Felid (and MAYBE Kobolds, being hairy, could have this), you like roll around on a wand or something, draining all it's charges.
1. Train spellcasting even if you never want to learn a spell. A good 3-4 levels will do. I forgot about doing that and ended up getting stuck between a rock and a hard place (an Unseen Horror) with my TrMo of Chei. My backup plan was Slouch, but... yea, cant cast slouch with 3 mana!
1. Must learn spell is: Sticks to Snakes, with this, you can try to conquer Elven Hall. This is one of the best spell, for killing all elves, quick and easy.
1. For example, Octopode is Op because those are on the syllables. Spriggan is Sp because those are the first two letters, presumably because it has 3 syllables.
1. This might be a bit out there, but check it out. Change Felid to Familiar. Put in a mechanic that gives you the chance to convert any spellcaster based on your charms skill. Make the total amount of things you can have charmed based on level. You can probably take away the nine-lives thingy at this point.
1. Maybe the better solution is to add a "scroll of disarmament" to the game, which removes all traps (discovered or not) in LoS. Then they could actually add MORE deadly, unavoidable traps and trap-based vaults to the game
1. see <a href="#agra">agra</a>: He's weilding the mighty Agra unrandart which is about as deadly as that quick blade I had if not deadlier. [...] Seriously look at how good this guy was he had a freaking demon whip and the mighty Agra (which is like the most broken fixedart axe ever speed brand which almost always hits for tons of damage).
1. I find that shields fulfill the same role as vampiric weapons do.
1. 1. Sacrificing items causes glow and can mutate you. Therefore all sacrifices require risk.
1. see <a href="#crawl[16]">crawl[16]</a>: 2H weapons tend to be more popular with the "in" crowd of good players on ##crawl.
1. Making non-weapons not attack sounds workable. This would be a nerf to Mara though, wouldn't it? The old wielded bread ration trick would produce ghosts without melee attacks.
1. I think that GDR should be shown as an in-game attribute of armours; it is just as significant, if not moreso, than EV penalty and AC bonus.
1. I am looking at adding something along the lines of a Thirst factor, allowing for branches like the abyss to become more realistic, plus adding the way for additional branches like a desert scene plausible for those with the creative mindset. ... Spells that cause an alcohol induced behavior could as well be used to dehydrate a player
1. Idea: there is a chance of Haste berserking you that decreases with spellpower.
1. I promptly got assaulted by a herd of skeletal warriors backed up by Yaktaurs, so I moved toward them, taking a crap load of damage with each step. So I initiate teleport, then invoke rage.
1. When a wall is in some way removed, if there is lava or deep water next to it, the water or lava should have a chance to flood the area that is next to the wall that is dug
1. Cooking will require a camp fire, requiring a fire spell, wand, or scroll be cast on a wooden object. Reliable cooking would require carrying these materials with you.
1. In keeping with the original Dungeon Crawl by Atari, poisons makes you sick. Sickness is a part of the game. If you only got poisoned once while playing, you would be asking "Why is that there? Seems like it should happen more often."
1. Overall I would prefer HOBe due to the relatively great casting capability.
1. [*] Paralysis prevents the eating of chunks. [*] Being unable to eat prevents the eating of chunks.
1. "it's [OTR's] an extremely deadly level 4 nuke"
1. What if each turn you hold the orb, your hp decreases by 1 for every rune you collected?
1. Rather than skill aptitudes, why not make all values of skills significant and start species with -3 aptitude at -3 skill level instead, and let them build up to 0 and positive skill values? This would allow 0 to represent a significant value rather than an absence of skill.
1. A wand of crowd control could go summon mammal -&gt; meph -&gt; OTR -&gt; fireball -&gt; poison cloud -&gt; ice storm (extremely rare)
1. [acquirement] ...looking over player comments, it seems the best option is to just take gold. There shouldnt be a best option, especially something as mundane as generic wealth. It should be a real choice between all of the possibilities (after character considerations are taken). Honestly, who _ever_ takes potion, for example?
1. Put it in Mantis as a feature request to increase the likelihood of it happening.
1. [on a proposed mechanism for player resurrection] - It even can start to spawn only after the graveyard reaches some definite amount of corpses (let's say 10) and stop spawning after you retrieve several Orbs of Zot (let's say 5).
1. I'm fighting Azrael. I get him down a large notch, then being adjacent to me, he hellfires me. My rf+++ doesn't let me get hurt much, but it completely kills him. [...] Per the bots, your rF+++ didn't help you [...] Well, yeah but my rN+ may have helped.
1. Necromutation makes it so, so much easier. rPois and rN+++ in one spell.
1. Mummies have enormous advantages that are not apparent looking at the attributes chart. From a defensive perspective, there is no better race.
1. I changed my mind now about the optimal class for Mummies. Scratch Necromancer. Again, it's Stalker. Actually Stalker may be a bit overpowered, and I really dread the next version of Crawl because I strongly suspect the developers are going to clip the wings of Stalkers.
1. Throw icicle (summoning/ice, level 4) - change this from conjuration to summoning
1. I think a third of the code would vanish instantly if _all_ calculations were done in floating point arithmetic instead of integers (is there a _real_ reason why you cannot have 17.5 HP or 3.14159 MP?).
1. vitrify can make dangerous walled levels such as Zot:5 or elf:3 significantly more predictable by turning the walls transparent.
1. Besides which, any wise Troggie treats 'aa' as if it doesn't exist anyhow and just uses him for his other attributes.
1. If you need to use exponets, squares, and other complex equations then your system is poorly designed at its base. Do you really want professional mathamaticians as your only target audience?
1. Weapon speed effects how often you hit. To hit percentage effects how often you hit. That is the definition of redundant, and my ability to spell has absolutely no impact on the discussion being made. Stop making ad hominem attacks.
1. a 3/5 Potion of Speed mixed with a 1/5 Potion of Strength and a 1/5 Potion of Gain level nets the player a Potion of "Lose 1 Point Of Accuracy For Every Level of Strength" (because it's hard to control the super fast movements).
1. Make weapons the exception. Hitting v itself won't do anything while wielding a weapon, just like the ctrl key does. It'll work only when it's combined with directional command. Pressing any combination of two keys simultaneously is always guaranteed to have no problem in standard keyboards.
1. The gladiator is built around a mechanic that doesn't exist in the game: light armored melee.
1. I think the traps in DC should be generally deadlier. So if you want to avoid instant death caused by traps, you`d have to train doors&amp;traps skill.
1. Maybe it's a big part of why I don't win much, but I don't walk away from things once I've started fighting them more than once every ten games.
1. Chei will get you very large boosts to your main stats at high piety which will make large rocks into tactical nukes. [...] Reduced metabolism and an easier time in the abyss and on the orb run are nice perks too. The vastly increased stats also make death curses from mummies much less potent making it easier to get through tomb.
1. An idle thought on demigods: Why not change the hard restriction on worship to a soft restriction? Slower piety gain and longer wrath, for example. Just throw a warning at the player when trying to worship/abandon a god.
1. Related to this, do you think it's possible to win with 15 runes using a ranged-only melee character?
1. Dreaded going to the Abyss? Given the power you were wielding? Ah right, Naga without Chei or CBoE. Also, can't you fly over Zot traps? You had Tornado so that would have lifted you in the air.
1. For all other species moving on ground is primary and water is an obstacle. Make octopodes primary water creatures and implement a minivault random cave river system.
1. More recently, I switched to the git version, which currently has a hilariously difficult idea of what monsters to generate -- but also generates significantly better items (and is way prettier) - hence "Hard Mode".
1. This being the issue of the cloak and amulet slots, and how they are subject to the exact sort of nobrainer decisions that this game avoids in most other areas. If you find rMut, you use that, and only that, in your amulet slot.
1. That is only true if the choice of viable endgame gods for a warrior of Yred was more than just TSO.
1. The only species that is attempted to be designed to not have any favorable playstyle is the Human - which is of course equally horrible at all playstyles and could have recommendations set to nothing as a result
1. The sole reason I learnt dragon form is to spam sub.blood on myself: i.e. the +60% HP bonus. Of course I should only do this when I don't need to run away and am in no danger of being hit.
1. Not recommended if you’re following Sif or Veh, at least not without plenty of firepower (literally—using Fire Storm is not out of the question to safely kill the Unseen Horrors).
1. Advantages for Kobolds don't really matter because it doesn't make up for the Kobolds Main Disadvantages
1. Perfume bomb: Temporarily charms/enslaves its victims. Powerful against groups of Orcs and beasts, but less so against high MR enemies. Remote controlled robot bomb: Take control of a walking bomb for several turns, leaving yourself open to attack. Water balloon: Sends the enemy into a berserk rage.
1. What if we make special combat moves like spells? This way, pure fighters will find use in those mp laying around.
1. Generally speaking, about, Dragon armours and their place in the game design, why is the Gold Dragon Armour far better than the others (offering 3 useful resistances instead of one, and a huge GDR).
1. Cheibriados forces their followers to wear a tortoise shell on their back for training. The shell can be removed for the purpose of wearing armour, but it can't be taken off otherwise. It takes up the cloak slot.
1. Disadvantage: You lose your face...you are unable to eat, drink or read (but still perceive your surroundings...although with reduced LOS). Advantage: You gain the ability to adopt the face of a dead creature. You will slice the face and wear it as a mask, gaining different abilities depending on the general type of monster.
1. Falling asleep and dropping random items from time to time seems fun
1. I propose that Cheibriados prevents you from speeding your weapon up through training weapon skill, so that all weapons act at maximum delay.
1. I could see this as a level 4-5 charm Delay that, when cast, requires you to cast any other spell immediately afterward, penalizable at that time to miscasts, which on successful cast would be "held" till released, not unlike how Delayed Fireball works now. Then we'd ditch the Delayed Fireball spell.
1. I can't believe your bad luck -- completed orc AND elf, AND the vaults and dungeon . . . . and no rMut
1. wyrmbane makes a great throwing weapon imho.
1. I can't say I like the idea of a weaker weapon dealing less damage then a stronger weapon.
1. Low-level Trog worshippers and casters w/o melee yet should not wear-ID specifically because of Hunger. Without remove curse, which is admittedly plentiful, hunger will limit your options to melee-only.
1. I suggest to limit number of useful magic schools to 3 [...] No character can have more than 3 magic schools with skills greater than 3. So you still can have Necromancy 3, Air 3, Ice 3, Hexes 3 etc if you wish so.
1. The nice thing about being a Wizard is getting resistances up is a lot easier since I can use artifact weapons for added resistance without worrying how they affect my melee ability since I never melee anything.
1. Logunu, to me, is the "Early blink in heavy Armour" god.
1. Emos is the diety of self loathing. He likes it when you take damage, cast Pain (and related spells), drink detrimental potions, read scrolls of immolation, etc. He dislikes it when you use any heal potions, wands, or regeneration spells. Emos refuses to accept worship from beings that cannot feel pain.
1. Still it would be stupid to use GSC (even with Maces&amp;Flails 22+ and Fighting 27) vs low HP targets. I think we do not have any disagreements in the latest part of the thread since everyone understands how melee fighting works...
1. The AK had a much easier time due to the big SH value that defended him, while the AM's Vampiric Giant Club could only restore so much health.
1. Lichform allows to almost ignore Int
1. Anit-Cheribdos Diety - Like the killing of slower creatures, promotes the use of quickblades, branded speed weapons, and boots of running. Dislikes the use of any slowing rods/spells on anything, amulets of stasis, use of ponderous equipment, and resting (lose 1 piety every 25 turns while resting).
1. I propose monsters that can cast spells drop their spellbooks. Said spell books would contain all the spells the monster can cast. (Possibly minus monster only spells, although I think that allowing the player to get his hands on them this way would be acceptable.) This would clear up the problem of spell book rarity.
1. it rather seems to be that the hardest core of players is already bored from streaking and puts the impossible races towards the end (hello Mummies, Humans and Demigods)
1. MONS: big kobold name:Jibjub name_replace MONS: kobold name:Nitkik name_replace MONS: big kobold name:Kiblib name_replace
1. HP is irrelevant for non-lich and non-undead character. After 4 torments you will have to use Death's Door/Born's Revivication no matter if you are an Ogre or Felid because 80HP difference is 5HP difference now (80/16).
1. - You're a wizard, that means you don't get involved in fistfights or primitive melees with pointy things. That is for peasants with no class. If you ignore this you deserve to die, which you likely will.
1. Almost never have I seen anything remotely threatening in damage coming from Darts or Stones outside of the Early Game, and I would rather take a Orc Warlord throwing Stones at my Squishy Caster with Repel Missiles at range while I cast Poison Arrow or Bolt of Fire with glee at him.
1. Crossbows are different from Bows and Slings in that you can load them and it will be ready to fire when you need it to be; Bows and Slings however don't stay loaded and always require a setup phase before firing. In terms of Crawl, the purpose of Reloading would be that you could fire your Loaded Crossbow instantly.
1. But haste make you hungry.
1. resist mutation almost a must for most characters if you want to win.
1. The Amulet of Rage is a really interesting Amulet for Trog Worshipers
1. Lightning Bolt is at 1% failure but I cannot spam it because of spell hunger. Hat provides +5 Int which saves 50 food points for every Lightning Bolt and I have Swiftness to compensate pondering.
1. Anyways, there were some critics, but I honestly think this is good. -3 ring mail {rF+ rC+ rN+ MR str+1} Sure it would need a better base type/enchantment to be the best, but I have a hard time saying 4 resists is not a notable randart ;)
1. i'm pretty sure you can't win as long as any enemy is in your LOS so if you end up being followed to the exit you have to deal with the panlord a way or another.
1. (Achievements) Overachever: Do a 15 rune game. I wanna be the guy!: Do a 15 rune game as a halfling fighter.
1. This modification [elemental attacks can heal certain monsters] would be another way to make uniques or random/unique Pan lords more exciting and force the player to be more careful. Imagine the horror when you mistakenly cast Fire Storm instead of Ice Storm: "Cerebov basks in the healing power of your fire magic."
1. Extispicy - Divination / Necromancy. Dissembowl a fresh corpse. Divine how many monsters of this type remain in the level. Balance feature: Trades potential food for very limited information.
1. Due to their speed, until it runs out of ammo, centaurs and yaktaurs should maintain a two space buffer between themselves and the target player.
1. OOD for floor 1 is gonna be what; like Orc-Knight/Trolls probably. Say you kept restarting till you found a good rod or two--maybe something with ice storm or a good swarm of medium summons. Level 6 evo-hunger is a non-issue and unlike spells your evocations are guaranteed success from a rod. Keep blink/mephitic as your escapes and you're golden!
1. My understanding was that Sif Muna protects from miscasts and Lichform protects from spell hunger so Mummy of Sif Muna can spam Ice/Fire Storm earlier than DEWz of Vehumet can.
1. What about changing the disposition of the loot in the labyrinth so that, instead of having it all in a pile by the exit with the Minotaur sitting on top, it's scattered at random around the labyrinth?
1. I ditched Trog late in the game in hopes of getting some casting going but I ended up getting the orb and getting out of there before really being much of a caster. Oh well, the stat bonuses from Che were great.
1. one wierd thing about Cure Mut potions that always bothers me - every other "good" potion has 100 percent positive results (heal, cure, +foo, etc) even Invis which doesn't add glow like a spell would.
1. On a related note with mummies, how do they get rid of mutations generally? If you get some really bad mutation, do you worship Jivya, or what?
1. also,what is the point of necromancers anyway,when you only start as one for the animate dead spell?if i wanted undead support for melee,i could start as a melee background and worship kiku or yredelemnul
1. Suddenly getting your cards scrambled because now your DsFE you rushed to make proficient at firestorming suddenly can't do it as much without toasting itself isn't something that takes a couple of floors to adapt to.
1. is it worth risking a ring of faith (don't really want it this game) or inaccuracy over just keeping the stasis ammy on for now?
1. Joking aside, the only time apportation is useful is if some vault designer decided to place an item on top of a teleporter trap. That is literally the only time I have ever used that spell.
1. Just bad luck? Dunno but it seriously hurts a lot of (maybe only my) builds as they are more or less dependent on Swamp Dragon Armour which is almost never encountered anywhere but Swamp. It´s actually become to the point that I’ve altogether stop playing 0.11+ if I’m playing a toon even remotely dependent on Swamp Armour.
1. This is a tree with 13 fruits (pomegranates?) on it. It is pretty heavy (~100 aum). Eating one will activate the tree. One of the fruits starts to rot. Eating this one will act like a manual for training a random Spell School. It will also cause nausea [...] it should give more xp to ogres, to compensate for their appalling aptitudes.
1. I am not sure Necromutation is overestimated by players. It makes you immune to Torments/Mutations (rot can be healed eventually). So you basically choose either good gods or necromutation. Also necromutation is very nice because it lets you wear 2 regeneration rings or cast level 9 spells without any hunger issues.
1. I see nothing wrong with Necromutation on a fighter (even on MiBe who abandoned Trog). It just requires extended for exp. I would farm Pan for Necromutation skills before trying Hell.
1. SE is not a Mi so it should not melee dangerous things so early even with vamp lajatang.
1. On gitorious, there's a link at each branch to let you download the branch as a tar-ball. [...] Thanks! Allthough this does raise another question: why is the data for crawl stored on magnetic tapes?
1. Increase Okawaru piety gain when wearing Amulet of Inaccuracy or negative slaying bonuses during applicable attacks. Decrease piety gain similarly when wearing positive slaying during an applicable attack.
1. Actually, I don't think many people use Magical Staves for actual Melee combat. Having to train up Evocations, Staves, the Appropriate Spell School, and Fighting is quite a bit of experience to tally up to make a Magical Stave a viability weapon.
1. I'm sure there's many people who'd rather play a caster for their first win. I myself haven't won a caster yet, even after 16 wins. All have been melee/archers so far, some of which had support magic (My DrMo had dragon form which I don't think qualifies as spellcasting
1. I would not consider it wasting id scroll on amulet of faith. The amulet is almost useless for Sif Muna
1. Zin is the holy equivalent of lich-form as far as I'm concerned.
1. Necromancy is a rather nice spell school, but most of the time the only races who choose the necromancer background are Deep Dwarves and Mummies.
1. I'm of the opinion that most of the gods made to have generalized appeal (Ash, Jyvia) need some kind of buff
1. I'm a bit suspicious of any weapon with a base delay higher than 120 that isn't exclusive to ogres and trolls.
1. Of course, that is why you choose Sif. [...] Oh I should note it wouldn't be that big of a problem if I ate intelligent beings, but I sort naturally follow a Zin level diet. This is more of a mental handicap then a deliberate one.
1. create level 9 spell of poison magic which instantly transfers all Poison Magic skill points into spellcasting. The spell cannot be cast if its failure rate is above 10%. Thus Venome Mage has 2 options: 1) abandon Poision Magic as done nowadays 2) train Poison Magic to have the spell castable and transfer skill points.
1. What about a spell that permanently stops health regeneration on the target, so you can hit it, run away to heal and regain mp, then come back and finish the job?
1. This seems like a good idea, but maybe just to simplify things - make it so any Unarmed Combat Strike counts for a Full Stabbing Bonus. This would be with Claws or without any Claws; though stabbing chance could be effected by size.
1. So i scamm the WinRar version of Trunk and decided to play a MiBe because they cleave throu anything in their path. After i cleared the Sewer he gifts me a doble sword of holy wrath. An ice dragon in the lair ended his Rampage, but because i scamm the WinRar version he doesn't die. (Trollface)
1. I do not understand this. In what sense does moving help in defeating an ogre?
1. So DD is strong? I have never heard this.
1. Also wielding Vapiric Axe so not really in mood to using wands.
1. Fog (lvl 1, Illusion/Air) Creates a cloud field at the caster’s location, similar to scroll of fog. The clouds can fill whole LOS and stay very long with high spell power. This one is probably nearly useless, but I’ll wait for your judgment.
1. IMO Berskerker is easy for early game. For me winning is easier as follower of Oka, coz when following Trog you usually go with 2-handed weapons, and shields do miracles in lategame (especially shield of reflection)
1. going from Trog ---> Chei ensures the easiest Trog wrath ever
1. I think one of the distinctions between rings and amulets could be that all rings have an enchantment level and their effect is altered according to it. Ring of rFire/rCold: each ench lvl gives you a 10% conservation chance [...] Ring of rElec: each ench lvl gives you a 5% chance to resist paralysis
1. The immunities stasis gives are absolutely wonderful.
1. why phytoon?i think that vb.net and phytoon and other programming languages which need something on a pc installed beforehand are not universal enough.I mean,not every computer has it,but pretty much every computer has the files necessery for c++ applications
1. I have to say that Trog is even more powerful when he doesn't gift you anything.
1. had to look it up in Help, so there is really an option of "quit without saving". This sounds stupid. I wonder what did the programmers have in mind when they put this into the game.
1. The only transmutation that supports spellcasting is necromutation.
1. Apportation is a curious spell. In a normal 3-rune game it is practically useless.
1. There are three options to take tomb: 1) ring of sustained abilities 2) worship chei
